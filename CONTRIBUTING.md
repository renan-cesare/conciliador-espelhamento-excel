# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in this project.

This repository is primarily intended as a **portfolio and reference implementation**
for access reconciliation and governance workflows using Excel data.

## Scope

Small improvements are welcome, such as:
- documentation refinements
- code organization
- readability and robustness improvements

Changes that require real access lists, internal identifiers,
or corporate permission data should **not** be included.

## Data and security

- Do not include real user names, emails, or IDs
- Do not include real access matrices or permission spreadsheets
- Use only synthetic or placeholder data when necessary
